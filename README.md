# Welcome

Edit 64 is a simplistic game engine and editor for Nintendo 64 titles that have been ported to PC
It was originally going to be a tool used to creat *Super Mario 64 PC* mod, but I decided to just make it a game engine as well.

It has two main parts:
1. The Editor
2. The Engine

## Editor
This is the program for creating the game itself.

## Engine
This is what games made by the *Editor* run on

## Detaching
The *Engine* is used by the editor for graphics, memory management, and more.
When the game is compiled, the *Engine* becomes part of the game as well


## Other Modules

### The Connector
This just combines the game's code and contents with the game engine itself to make the game

### Qt
Just simply Qt libraries and Qt interface classes
It is part of the *Editor*

### OpenGL
A part of the *Engine* that is for graphics rendering.
There will be more graphics libraries like Direct3D


Current Version: v0.0.5
