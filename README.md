Edit 64 is a simplistic game engine and editor for Nintendo 64 titles that have been ported to PC

It's designed to make game thar are as efficient as possible. If Microsoft Flight Simulator was using this game engine, an old computer from the 90's could run it, and
it would be less than 10G in size. Although it wouldn't look as beautiful.

Unique Features (at least that I know from other game engines):
A memory manager:
Shows the designated memory of every data from the game when it will be compiled
Values are shown in hexadecimal by default


Current Version: v0.0.5
