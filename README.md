# Welcome

Edit 64 is a simplistic game engine and editor for Nintendo 64 titles that have been ported to PC
It was originally going to be a tool used to create *Super Mario 64 PC* mod, but I decided to just make it a game engine as well.

It has two main parts:
1. Edit64
2. Engine64

## Engine64
A library to help in game development

## Editor64
A visual game editor that uses the Engine64 Library


## Dependent Libraries

### Qt
Just simply Qt libraries and Qt interface classes
It is part of *Edit64*

### OpenGL
A part of *Engine64* that is for graphics rendering.
There will be more graphics libraries like Direct3D

### SDL2
Input and audio for *Engine64*

## GLM
OpenGL mathematics library for 3D projection and vertex transformations.


Current Version: v0.1.5
